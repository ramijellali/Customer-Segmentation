# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

Welcome to the **Customer Segmentation** project! 🎉

In this project, we apply K-Means Clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. This allows businesses to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and normalized the dataset to ensure high-quality input for the clustering algorithm.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Implemented K-Means to identify customer segments with similar purchasing patterns.
- **Visualization:** Used various plots to visualize the clusters and understand the characteristics of each segment.
- **Evaluation:** Analyzed the clustering results to ensure meaningful and actionable customer segments.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for clustering.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis and clustering implementation.
- `src/`: Python scripts for preprocessing and clustering.
- `models/`: Saved clustering models for further analysis.
- `README.md`: You're reading it! 📄
